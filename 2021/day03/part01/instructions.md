## Part 01

The first parameter to check is the power consumption

You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate
two new binary numbers, gamma rate and the epsilon rate

`power consumption = gamma rate * epsilon rate`

The gamma rate can be determined by finding the most common bit in the
corresponding position of all the numbers. Of the first bit in all numbers,
there are seven 1s and five 0s so the first bit of the gamma rate is a 1

The epsilon rate can be determined by finding the least common bit in the
corresponding position of all the numbers. Of the first bit in all numbers,
there are seven 1s and five 0s so the first bit of the epsilon rate is a 0
